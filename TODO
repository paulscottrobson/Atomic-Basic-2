- Figure out why 'Q code' not working.

Progress
========
- Assignment (do $ completion code and x!?$y processing)
- Command Line, tokenisation, executing from keyboard.
- LIST 
- GOTO GOSUB 
- IF THEN 
- DO LOOP 
- FOR TO NEXT STEP
- LINK
- INPUT PRINT

Later fixes
===========
- Ctrl+C check add. ReadKey scans but doesn't clear, ClearKey resets.
- Fix long read/write for ! and ? to use the extended access on Mega65
